              <div class="for-plain">
                <img src="/images/mejay.jpg" class="image-right" />
              <p>Jayme and Daniella first met in college (GO TERPS!) while Daniella was living in the infamous "Cocktail Lounge" apartment and Jayme was pledging the Delta Chi fraternity. One typical class-skipping Thursday (sorry mom and dad), Daniella and some of her friends decided to play drinking games at "Cocktail Lounge." The boys (we won't tell you who to save them from embarassment, Liguori & Christman) inevitably "trashed" the beloved Cocktail Lounge. The girls had nothing to do with the mess, obviously...</p>
              <p>The boys graciously sacrificed one of their pledges to clean the apartment. So who did they end up sending? None other than "Jaymo Dollas." Not only did he have to clean a disgusting apartment, but he was told he had to "throw an original pick-up line" at each girl. </p>
                <p>Well, just as you suspected, Jaymo KILLED it with the pick-up lines. Daniella and Jaymo got closer and closer as the year went on, before ultimately falling in love during the summer of 2010.</p>
                  <p> And the rest is history.</p>

                     I make her sleepover against her will when Jayme is out of town in order to keep me company - often times I find
                     oreos with her name on it hidden in random places throughout my apartment.
                  Nati has two awesome sisters. I've always been jealous and secretly pretended
                  I was their 4th sister, often times showing up uninvited like Kris Jenner.

                   <p class="girlinfo">Sam and I met freshman year of college when UMD thought it was it was a good idea to force three girls to split a two-person dorm. Fortunately, the tight quarters allowed us to become very good friends and we were roommates for all four years of college. Sam is an incredible partner-in-crime, especially when you're in the mood to order pizza and mozzarella sticks while lying around watching a "Friends" marathon. I've always looked up to her. She probably doesn't know this, but I spent the majority of our freshman year trying to copy her hairstyle. I eventually gave up because I realized she just has way better hair. Sam has been my confidant from the start and was the first person I ever told about Jayme.
                    <br><strong><br>The first CD that Sam ever bought was the Bring It On Soundtrack.</strong>

                   <p class="girlinfo">Aimee and I have been friends since middle school. It all started with our mutual obsession with N'Sync (even though she still doesn't know the words to any of their songs). Actually, she never knows the words to any songs, but that's one of my favorite things about her. Aimee and I grew up together through numerous sleepovers, 2am dance parties, and her Fergie phase when she would sing "big girls don't cry" on repeat and pretend she was in a music video. She is always looking out for me and giving me honest advice, and I know we have a bond that will last the rest of our lives.

She's the only one who ever understood my ADD moments and love for weird computer games like "The Sims". She's also the best beer pong partner and knows all the best drinking (and non-drinking) games, even when she just blatantly makes one up. She is such a happy, easy going person and even when she's having a bad day all you have to do is make her a colorful fruity drink (in a mason jar) and she'll cheer right up. I've never met anyone who gets so much joy out of the little things in life, like a fresh pajama outfit!

                   <p class="girlinfo">Linds and I have been friends since the beginning of high school, but we really fell in love drawing cartoon animal pictures of moles in 10th grade chemistry class. Apparently its a unit of measurement (see we learned something!) but we had more fun doodling moles and making Austin Powers quotes ("MOLEY MOLEY MOLEY!") and obviously driving our teacher crazy. Somehow that year we also coined the nicknames "Yoshi" and "Chu" for each other which stick to this day.</p>
                    <p class="girlinfo">She used to drive me crazy by momming me and telling me to cover up when I would dance like a fool in the parking lot before sports practice in my head-to-toe spandex (sorry I'm not sorry) but in reality we've spent most of the past 13 years keeping each other sane. Usually that's as easy as a quick phone call where we daydream about the day that we live happily ever after in house surrounded by elephants. One day (when Jayme is rich) I'll adopt a baby elephant for both of us to share.

Taylor was thrilled when Jayme and I moved just one block away from her apartment in Dupont, but I was the one who lucked out...inviting myself over for dinner multiple times a week. As annoying as I probably am, she always welcomes me with open arms. Taylor is one of my favorite people to hang out with on the weekends, whether it's dancing all night at a club or staying in to drink wine and watch "Magic Mike" with the pups.

I'm sure she fondly remembers how Sam and I kept blowing out her fuse because the two of us would use the hair dryer at once. That's actually how we met. I’ll never forget the look on her face when we walked by her dorm to finish blow-drying our hair in the bathroom. She still gives me that look when I constantly point out the fact that she loves horses (I think elephants are better, so I need to make sure she knows that). Hayley has always been someone I look up to – she is incredibly honest, kind, and thoughtful. We both share a very deep love of animals, and I am dying to have a puppy party with her. One day, Hayley!

She had a different teacher, but all I knew about this girl was that she was obsessed with pandas and anything that was purple – I’m sure her dream was to have a purple panda. In 4th grade I sat next to her everyday and she became one of my best friends that I love and cherish to this day. We nicknamed each other “pig” and “rat” because that’s what we decided each other looked like (we were so kind and very honest with each other…). We also thought it would be a great idea to start a band called "the blockheads." We had a pink briefcase and wrote a few songs, but for some reason we never made it. Maybe it was the lack of instruments or band-practice...or talent (well, my lack of talent – Laura has an incredible voice). Maybe we'll finally debut our act at the reception.

She literally couldn't stop laughing every time she mimicked my gesture (it was a squirrel licking its paw) – I knew right then that we were going to be great friends. After college, Britt and I went to spin class together every Thursday after work, followed by beers, milkshakes, and mozzarella sticks at a diner (we thought spinning continued to burn more calories after working out at the time…). Britt is the sassiest bitch you'll ever know, but she doesn't bite I promise. She's actually very kind and easy going. We've had some really great times together and I can't wait for more!

Mainly because she just starts laughing for no reason – her laughter and smile are infectious. I call her “squirrel tail” because she used to have a really bushy ponytail during our early morning anthropology class in high school. We've had a lot of fun together, including getting ready for dances in middle school and obsessing over a particular boy who shall remain nameless – we used to use his name in Spanish class when we had to make up sentences. She currently lives in Charleston, and I can't wait to visit her and pass along the "squirrel tail" nickname to all her new friends there.

                   <p class="girlinfo">Devin was one of the "older guys" in my fraternity when I pledged and I always really looked up to him. Although we always got a long famously in college, we've grown even closer in the years since we've graduated. There isn't a topic he can't turn into a full blown original song.
                     <strong><br><br>Devin's first car was a 1999 Toyota Corolla Station Wagon.</strong>
